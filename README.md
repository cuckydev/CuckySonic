# CuckySonic
An accurate Sonic the Hedgehog engine in C++.

(NOTE: There currently are no development tools, and this is still getting *very* actively worked on, so I wouldn't suggest using this for the time being)

## Compiling (Windows - MSYS2)
1. Install MSYS2

2. Install the following packages:

	`base-devel`

	`mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`

	`mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2`



3. Clone the repository (using whichever Git client of your choice)

4. Go into the resulting repository (ex. cd C:/CuckySonic)

5. To build, simply just input `make` with any of the below parameters

`RELEASE=...` if 0, a debug build will be created, if 1, an optimized release build will be created

`STATIC=...` if 1, the .exe will be compiled with all of the required libraries stored internally (preferred on)

`BACKEND=...` This sets which backend to use, the only implemented backend at the moment is SDL2, leaving this blank will probably cause big issues

`WINDOWS=...` This will overwrite what's determined by the makefile, you won't need to set this unless you're doing cross-compilation, or it's just not setting properly for any other reason

The compiled executable will be in the build folder.
